<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I'm Gavin, a current intern at Meta on the DevInfra team. I love the work that
my Metamates are doing in Reality Labs, and would love to work on the Metaverse
one day.
</p>

<p>
I'm going into 4th year at Imperial College London for my Master's degree in
Computer Science, graduating next year in 2023. I also run the University's VR/AR
society, as the current President.
</p>

<p>
On this website, I aim to showcase some of my favourite VR projects, and
highlight my experiences. Hopefully they are interesting to you.
