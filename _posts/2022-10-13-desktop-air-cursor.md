In the Imperial College London #ichack22 hackathon, our team won first place for the Best Entertainment Hack category.
  Our team built the Magic Wand desktop app, which allows any computer with a webcam to be turned into a "touch screen"
  by using a computer vision algorithm to accurately detect hand movement and gestures.

I developed gesture support from the raw computer vision data by programming the algorithms required for the program
  to recognise various hand gestures like scrolling, dragging and skipping through media.
  
The software was developed in Python with cross-platform support for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Check out a demo of our 
  final product below.
