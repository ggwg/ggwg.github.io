## **Business Models**

A business model provides a core logic for creating value. 

**Business Model Canvas**: Defined by three main sections - value configuration, value creation, and value capture

Examples include:

- Razor-and-blade model
- Advertising model

## **Complements**

- Components that increase the value of an industry's product
- Value shared between producers of complementary products results in profit accruing to the supplier with a stronger market position
- Example: iPhone's App Store and AirPods

## **Ecosystems**

- A business ecosystem can be defined as independent firms using common standards and collectively providing goods and services to their customers
- Change within a business ecosystem causes value migration between firms and groups of firms
- Firms can influence value migration within an ecosystem in order to increase their share of value within the system

## **Network Effects**

- Network effects occur within an industry when one customer's product or service has a positive effect on the value of that product for other customers
- Example: Platform business models like Airbnb, Uber, and social networks such as Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook

## **Winner-take-all Industries**

- In some industries, the notion of industry attractiveness is meaningless because one firm takes all the industry's profits while others earn little or no profit
- These industries tend to have extreme scale economies or network externalities, e.g., search engines, online auction sites, and social networks

## **Competitive Interaction and Game Theory**

- Game Theory can be applied to mentalities whereby frames of strategic decisions as interactions between competitors are made to predict outcomes of competitive situations involving few evenly matched players
- Provides key insight into the nature and determinants of interaction among competitors
- Example: Competition and cooperation, deterrence, changing the power of the game, commitment, and signaling

## **Strategies to Manage Competition**

- Competitive analysis
    - Competitors' current goals
    - Assumptions about the industry and themselves
    - Key strengths and weaknesses
    - Predictions of strategy changes and responses
- Example: Strategic groups within the global automotive industry

## **Segmentation**

- Strategy is not about making every customer happy
- Identify key variables and categories
- Construct a segmentation matrix
- Analyze segment attractiveness
- Identify key success factors in each segment
- Analyze similarities and benefits of broad vs. narrow scope

## **Beyond Porter's 5 Forces**

- Complements Force: Suppliers of complements can create value for the industry and exercise bargaining power
