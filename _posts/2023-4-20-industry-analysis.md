1. Planning and Positioning (deliberate strategy): Planning, positioning. Predictable process, fairly predictable outcomes.
    1. Choosing rationally, weighing up opportunities and threats. Consider Michael Porter’s 5 forces for competitive strategy or use quantitative methods of evaluation such as discounted cash flows.
2. Organisational Learning (Emergent Strategy): Learn what works. Predictable process, unpredictable outcomes.
    1. Learning what works through predictable processes to determine unpredictable outcomes. External environment defines the strategy.
3. Resource-based view (entrepreneurial strategy): Use what you have. Means driven approach.
    1. Using your resources and capabilities, proactively shape your environment. Means-driven rather than goals driven. Internal resources and capabilities define the business strategy.
